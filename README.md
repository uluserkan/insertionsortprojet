Insertion Sort Steps:

[22, 27, 16, 2, 18, 6]  // Initial - First Step

↓

[2, 22, 27, 16, 18, 6]  // After 1. Step

↓

[2, 6, 22, 27, 16, 18]  // After 2. Step

↓

[2, 6, 16, 22, 27, 18]  // After 3. Step


Big-O: Process starts from n to 1, the sum of the numbers from 1 to n will give the result.

n.(n+1)/2 =n^2

    ->  o(n^2)
    
Time Complexity: [6,2,16,18,22,27]

6 is Lower
27 is Higher
18 is Middle

So,

18 = Average Case
